# API Gateway Microservice

An API gateway takes all API calls from clients, then routes them to the appropriate microservice with request routing,and protocol translation. Typically it handles a request by invoking multiple microservices and aggregating the results, to determine the best path. It can translate between web protocols and web-unfriendly protocols that are used internally.
